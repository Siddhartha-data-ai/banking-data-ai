## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Implemented through secure views with dynamic filtering:

```sql
-- Branch managers see only their branch customers
WHERE branch_id = get_user_branch_id()

-- Regional managers see only their region
WHERE region_code = get_user_region()

-- Relationship managers see only assigned customers
WHERE relationship_manager_id = get_user_id()

-- Executives see all data
WHERE get_user_role() IN ('EXECUTIVE', 'C_LEVEL')

-- Compliance officers see flagged accounts
WHERE compliance_flag = TRUE OR get_user_role() = 'COMPLIANCE'
```

### Column-Level Security (CLS)

PII and sensitive financial data masking:

| Data Type | Access Level | Masking |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| SSN | Executive, Compliance, Risk | Full access |
| SSN | Others | `XXX-XX-1234` |
| Account Number | Account owners, Managers | Full access |
| Account Number | Others | `****1234` |
| Email | Authorized roles | Full access |
| Email | Others | `abc***@domain.com` |
| Phone | Customer service, Managers | Full access |
| Phone | Others | `XXX-XXX-1234` |
| Balance/Amount | Finance, Executives, Account owners | Full access |
| Balance/Amount | Analysts | Rounded to thousands |
| Credit Score | Risk team, Underwriters | Full access |
| Credit Score | Others | Hidden |
| Fraud Score | Fraud team, Security | Full access |
| Fraud Score | Others | Hidden |

### User Groups and Roles

- `executives`: Full access to all data
- `compliance_officers`: Access to all customer data and flagged accounts
- `fraud_analysts`: Access to fraud detection and suspicious activity
- `risk_managers`: Access to credit risk and loan data

### Supported Intents

- `account_balance`: Account balance inquiries
- `transactions`: Transaction history and search
- `fraud`: Fraud detection and alerts
- `credit`: Credit score and risk information
- `loans`: Loan status and applications
- `churn`: Customer churn risk

- `export`: Data export functionality

### Security Considerations

- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Respects Unity Catalog permissions
- ✅ Row-level security applied
- ✅ PII masking enforced
- ✅ Audit logging enabled
- ⚠️ Do NOT hardcode credentials in code
- ⚠️ Use environment variables for secrets

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### Data Quality Checks

Run data quality validation:
```bash
databricks bundle run validate_data_quality -t dev
```

### View Data Statistics

```sql
-- Customer data quality
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
    AVG(credit_score) as avg_credit_score,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN credit_score < 600 THEN 1 END) as subprime_customers
FROM banking_dev_bronze.customers.customers_raw;

-- Account distribution
SELECT 
    account_type, 
    COUNT(*) as account_count,
    AVG(balance) as avg_balance,
    SUM(balance) as total_balance
FROM banking_dev_bronze.accounts.accounts_raw
GROUP BY account_type;

-- Fraud analysis
SELECT 
    risk_category, 
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    AVG(fraud_score) as avg_fraud_score,
    SUM(transaction_amount) as total_amount
FROM banking_dev_gold.fraud_analytics.fraud_detection
GROUP BY risk_category;

-- Loan performance
SELECT 
    loan_type,
    loan_status,
    COUNT(*) as loan_count,
    AVG(default_probability) as avg_default_risk,
    SUM(loan_amount) as total_exposure
FROM banking_dev_gold.risk_analytics.credit_risk_summary
GROUP BY loan_type, loan_status;
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Data Volumes

Edit data generation scripts:
```python
# src/bronze/generate_customers_data.py
NUM_CUSTOMERS = 1_000_000  # Change to desired volume

# src/bronze/generate_transactions_data.py
NUM_TRANSACTIONS = 5_000_000  # Adjust transaction count

# src/bronze/generate_accounts_data.py
NUM_ACCOUNTS = 500_000  # Adjust account count
```

### Add New Analytics

1. Create new notebook in `src/gold/`
2. Add to job orchestration in `resources/jobs/etl_orchestration.yml`
3. Redeploy bundle:
```bash
databricks bundle deploy -t dev
```

### Customize Security Rules

Edit RLS/CLS functions in:
```
src/setup/03_create_gold_tables.sql
```

Add custom security views:
```sql
-- Example: Branch-specific customer view
CREATE VIEW banking_prod_silver.customers.customers_branch_view AS
SELECT * FROM banking_prod_silver.customers.customers_dim
WHERE branch_id = get_user_branch_id()
    OR is_member('executives');
```

### Add Custom ML Models

1. Create new model notebook in `src/ml/`
2. Follow MLflow best practices
3. Add to orchestration in `run_all_predictions.py`
4. Register model in MLflow Model Registry
